# DSA_assignment
This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) assignments.

# File Naming Convention
I have followed a simple naming scheme for my files:
a1q1 → Assignment 1, Question 1
a1q2 → Assignment 1, Question 2
a2q1 → Assignment 2, Question 1
…and so on.
This makes it easy to identify which assignment and question a file corresponds to.

# Language Used:
All assignments are coded in C++.
